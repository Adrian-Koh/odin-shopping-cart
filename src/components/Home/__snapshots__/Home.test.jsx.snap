          The Everything Shop was founded in Kingston, NY in 1865 by Kier Eagan. Driven by the desire to provide a one-stop-shop for the community's everyday needs, Kier worked with local suppliers to put as many essentials as he could on the shelves. As his vision grew to provide access to essential goods to everywhere in the world, The Everything Shop has expanded to other locations which includes Chicago, IL, Houston, TX and San Francisco, CA, among other locations. With the internet, we are proud to say that you can purchase our products from anywhere in the world. Thank you for stopping by!
